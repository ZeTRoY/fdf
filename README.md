# FdF project of school 42
 	was actually made by me in UNIT Factory
<hr>
<h3>Description</h3>
<hr>
  
This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to the program.  
  
Each number corresponds to a point in space:  
• The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.  
• The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.  
• The value corresponds to its altitude.  

	Here is an example:

	Do the next

>./fdf tests/maps/42.fdf
  
	and you will see:

After rotating we can see the next:

And without my info panel with increased altitude value:

Also I have an intro with buttons which we can press to perform some action like rotating or moving an object. Here's what it is:

By the way, I have a tracklist which you can listen to. Also you can turn on the next or the previous track by yourself :)

I've got the next tracks here:  
• Ludovico Einaudi - Indaco  
• Kyivstoner - Babosik (also known as Неизвестность - Бабосик)  
• Eldjey - Hey Guys (also known as Элджей - Hey Guys)  

Also you can check it not only on 42.fdf.  
For example here's a t1.fdf map:
